            policies. However, some providers may charge a cancellation fee to

            Cancellation after Work Commences: Once the expert has started

            conditions. In such cases, you may be eligible for a partial refund
            based on the progress made by the writer up to that point. However,
            the exact refund amount and policy will vary depending on the

            Late Cancellations: If you cancel your order when it is nearing or
            past the deadline, the service provider may not offer a refund or
            may provide only a partial refund. This is because the writer has
            already invested time and effort into completing the work.
